- yoooo
- im extremely new to coding, but i really want to learn
- the most my experience extends to is basic coding concepts
- such as the hour of code games, playground, essentially
- just gamified coding, using blueprints (like ue5)
- little blocks that's like a prebuilt line of code
- such as "if___ then ___"
- hoping to learn enough to actually create something usable.
